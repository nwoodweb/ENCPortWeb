		<h2>What is Catalysis?</h2>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_catalysis">Catalysis</a> is when  an enzyme interacts with ligands. The exact process of how this is accomplished is known as mechanism </p>

		<p> It is often misconstrued that the enzymes themselves conduct the reactions, which is false. Enzymes simply lower the amount of energy required to initiate the reaction</p>
		<p>In order to gain insight into how efficiently an enzyme can process ligands, kinetic assayts are conducted. </p> 
		<p>Kinetics assays entail exposing enzymes to their ligands in a controlled environment, allowing the reaction to proceed, then evaluating the concentration of end product using UV-Vis spectroscopy. </p>
		<h3>Case Study: Michaelis Menten Kinetics Model</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/wmatkins/kinetics/michaelis-menten.html">Michaelis Menten Model</a> (MM) is a mathematical model used to evaluate enzyme catalysis. MM takes a reductionist approach:</p>
		<ul style="font-size:18px;color:#ffffff">
			<li>The enzyme reaction mechanism is instantaneous, with no delays or intermediates</li>
			<li>The rate of binding between enzyme and ligand is equal to the rate of dissociation of enzyme and ligand, known as the Steady State Assumption</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The MM model suggests that enzymes have a maximal velocity <i>Vmax</i>, in which regardless of ligand concentration, the enzyme can only react to a certain extent. This gives the MM model its distinct logarithmic curve, as shown below. </p>
		<p>Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of a protein, <i>Kcat</i> can then be extrapolated</p>
