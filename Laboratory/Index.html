																<p>Scientists who study structural biology have access to a vast array of equipment to conduct their research, what is discussed is only a small sample fo the methods employed in the field on a routine basis</p>
																<h2>Catalysis</h2>
	<p>Enzymes lower the barriers necessary for chemical reactions by interacting with smaller molecules known as ligands, in a process known as catalysis</p>
	<p>The quantitative study of this activity is known as kinetics, and the study of how this is exactly accomplished is known as mechanism</p>

																<h2>Imaging</h2>
																<p>Researchers desire to have atomic-resolution images of the compounds they study, and employ three main methods to accomplish this: Cryogenic Electron Microscopy, Homology Modeling, and X-Ray Crystallography</p>

																<h2>Spectroscopy</h2>
																<p>Researchers employ various additional methods to study biomolecule characteristics.</p>
																<p>The use of concentrated radiation spectra, known as spectroscopy, allows a myriad of analytical methods to be employed, from determining protein concentration in solution, to detecting free radicals</p>
