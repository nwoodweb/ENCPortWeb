		<h2>Measuring Concentration with UV-Vis Spectroscopy </h2>
		<p> <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Physical_Methods_in_Chemistry_and_Nano_Science_(Barron)/04%3A_Chemical_Speciation/4.04%3A_UV-Visible_Spectroscopy">UltraViolet-VISable</a> light spectroscopy uses a laser within the ultraviolet and visible light spectrum of radiation to measure concentrations of compounds in a solution</p>
		<p>UV-Vis spectroscopy accomplishes this by using a laser, which is difracted against a crystal prism, passed through a polarized filter that allows for a specific spectrum to be used, then passed through the sample, stored in a container knowns as cuvette</p>

		<p>The passthrough is then measured as an absorbance reading by a Charge Coupling Device, and analysed using computer software in accordance to Beer's Law which asserts that the absorbance of a sample is equal to the light's path length multiplied by sample and the molecular attenuation coefficient (obtained separately). </p>
		<p>As UV-Vis spectroscopy gives an absorbance reading, Beer's Law can be manipulated to find the sample's concentration, and then predict the total concentration of the original sample prior to the experimental procedure</p>

		<h2>Radical Mechanisms with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</h2>
		<p>Enzymes can break down larger ligands into smaller components, or combine smaller ligands into larger end products during catalysis. The study of catalysis is known as mechanism</p>

		<p>In quantum mechanics, electrons usually are paired with regards to chemical reactions. However, many chemical reactions involve lone electrons, known as <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Fundamentals/Reactive_Intermediates/Free_Radicals">radicals</a></p>
		<p>Radical chemistry has many applications, including the manufacturing of plastics, pesticides, and production of precursor molecules for pharmaceutics<p>
		<p>Radical reactions are notorious for becoming runaway reactions. Organisms have developed mechanisms to mitigate these effects, including the use of enzymes such as Superoxygen Dismutase, which converts the radical Superoxide ion into ordinary Oxygen and Hydrogen Peroxide</p>
		<p> Some enzyme mechnisms rely on radicals. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> OXalate DeCarboxylase (OxDC) is predicted to rely on its use of oxygen to shuttle radicals as it breaks down Oxalate, normally toxic to bacteria, into Formate and Carbon Dioxide, normally not as toxic to bacteria </p>

		<p> To study this, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Physical_Methods_in_Chemistry_and_Nano_Science_(Barron)/04%3A_Chemical_Speciation/4.08%3A_EPR_Spectroscopy">(EPR)</a> is employed</p>
		<p>First developed in the Soviet Union, EPR uses radio waves, generated by a Microwave Bridge, to force the electrons in a system to become either antiparallel, or parallel, in a phenomenon known as the Zeeman Effect</p>

		<p>This electromagnetic force particularly effects radicals, and can generate specific banding patterns that confirm the presence of radical chemistry</p>



		<p> To examine OxDC's use of radicals in its mechanism, Cryo EPR is employed, where the OxDC sample is chilled to 4 Kelvin, or -449 Fahrenheit. This allows the transfer of radicals to be monitored with greater attention to detail.</p>
		<p> OxDC is also subjected to Spin Trapping, where a special compound is added that artificially slows down the transfer of radicals, allowing for a more general view of radical activity in the system</p>
