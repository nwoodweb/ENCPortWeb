		<p>Unlike genomics, which focuses strictly on genes, or wildlife biology, which studies organisms in their native habitat or in an enclosure, structural biology examines the specific features of the molecules that compose an organism, often down to the movement of subatomic particles, such as electrons, within a system</p>

		<h2>Biomolecules</h2>
		<p>Biomolecules are the basic building blocks of all living things on Earth, and include DNA, RNA, proteins, as well as lipid molecules</p>
		<p>The basic properties of each individual component of a biomolecule, known as monomer, adds up and contributes to the overall properties of the larger, final structure, known as a polymer</p>

		<h2>Laboratory Structural Biology Methods</h2>

		<p>Scientists use a myriad of unique methods to put theory into practice, ranging from exposing enzymes to the chemicals they react with, to blasting samples wiht X-rays to determine the structure.</p>

		<h2>Computational Structural Biology</h2>
		<p>Advancements in structural biology research has lead to a vast amount of data being produced</p>
		<p>To make this data easy to use and share, open-access databases have been made to curate experimental data</p>
		<p>Furthermore, some questions in biology are diffcult to answer in the field and in the laboratory, leading to the use of high performance computing to solve these tasks</p>
