		<p>Biomolecules are compounds essential for all living things, including some non-living things, such as viruses<p>
		<p>Biomolecules are often polymers, or singular units, known as monomers, bonded together</p>
	
		<p>Over decades, researchers have discovered the means of which living things survive in rather hostile environments. This process starts with the stored genetic code, known as DNA, which is then further processed with the destiny of maintaining the cell survivability, better known as homeostasis</p>

		<p> The network outlining the destiny of processed DNA is known as the Central Dogma, given the fact that it is universal for all living things on Earth, with exceptions such as HIV-1, a retrovirus that can complete the Central Dogma in reverse </p>

		<h2>DNA and RNA</h2>
		<p>DNA is the universal genetic code for all living things, and is transcripted with the ultimate goal of controlling the use of other biomolecules in and out of the cell, ensuring the survival of an organism</p>
		<p>RNA is an intermediate between DNA and proteins, and is translated into proteins by a unique structure known as the Ribosome</p>

		<h2>Proteins</h2>
		<p>Proteins serve as microscopic tools, which provide structure, process chemicals, and regulate organisms</p>

		<h2>Lipids, Steroids, and Hormones</h2>
		<p>Lipids constitute the fats, waxes, and membranous compounds of living things.</p>
		<p>Some lipids, known as steroids, are hormones, and are implicated in development</p>
